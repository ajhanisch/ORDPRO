# **SYNOPSIS**  
Orders Processor (Ordpro) is a script written in Python, compiled to an .exe, designed to automate processing orders.
  
# **DESCRIPTION**  
Orders Processor (Ordpro) is a program originally written in PowerShell, translated to and enhanced by Python, compiled to an .exe designed to help automate the processing, handling, splitting, editing, combining, copying, moving, organizing, and archiving of orders given in the format of one or more documents containing one to many orders on a daily basis and or processing any number of historical orders originally generated and output from an orders generating system called AFCOS. Allowing state-level and unit-level administrators to access, view, print, and manage orders for their unit/state easily.
    
# **FEATURES**  
* Logging  
  
Detailed logging of any and all actions performed by Ordpro will be within the LOGS directory of the working directory Ordpro is placed. Logging information is extremely detailed within each log file including times when all actions were taken, log level of each action, what action was performed, the success or failure of each action, as well as statistics of actions performed presented throughout. The log files are detailed and designed to allow users to answer questions about what actually happened when they used Ordpro, as well as make any potential debugging and or troubleshooting that much simpler. Detailed logging takes place regardless of verbosity enabled or disabled during time of processing.  

* iPERMS Automation  
  
 Ordpro bridges the gap of orders being processed and them quickly making it to each soldiers PERMS. When the user specifies the `â€“combine` option when creating orders, ordpro will combine the created orders into files that contain no more than two-hundred and fifty (250) orders in them to be immediately input into PERMS integrator with no manual editing or user interaction. This feature does the required editing and combining of orders, previously manually done by the unit administrator for each soldier. This feature allows a soldiers orders to be put into PERMS the same day, or hour for that matter, the order was published and distributed within AFCOS. This feature has helped a state-wide amount of soldiers PERMS data to be caught up from more than two (2) years behind in initial building of Ordpro in a matter of minutes.  
 
* Verbosity  
  
Detailed verbosity of script processing, mirroring the output within the log files, can be enabled in the console to allow the user to see the actions happen in real time. This is completely optional for the user. As a disclaimer for the user, this feature may slow down performance when processing thousands of orders and files.
    
# **DOCUMENTATION**  
++ WIKI UNDER CONSTRUCTION ++. Since translating from powershell to python, the wiki is currently out of date. Working to update this.

# **INSTALLATION**  
There are two different ways to get ordpro up and running. Both are very painless, one easier than the other.  
1. [Recommended] - **ordpro.exe** -- No installation required. Simply place **ordpro.exe** on the machine you deem your orders processing machine and it is ready to run immediately.

2. **ordpro.py** -- Installation of Python 3.6 is required on any machine running **ordpro.py**. While this is not complicated, it is simply an additional step that is needed in order to be up and running for processing orders.

# **USAGE**  
Running the tool:  
`.\ordpro.exe [options]`
  
Typical Usage Example:  
`.\ordpro.exe --input \\\path\to\input --output \\\path\to\output --create`
  
Options:   
  
Check the Wiki for detailed information on all CLI parameters and switches.
  
# **WISH LIST / TO DO**  
- [ ] Implement notification of when orders are processed
- [ ] Implement individual UIC 'registry file' for admins to see who/what/when orders were cut for that UIC
- [ ] Implement ability for soldiers' directories within UIC to move more often then when orders are cut
